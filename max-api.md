## Node for Max API overview

The Node for Max API documentation can be found [here](https://docs.cycling74.com/nodeformax/api/).

It's fairly easy to follow and includes methods for many of the typical Max behaviors that you're already familiar with (e.g. how to react to a bang, what to send out an outlet, etc).
